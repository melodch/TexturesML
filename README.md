# TexturesML

MTH2188 Machine Learning Project 1, Simrun Mutha and Melody Chiu

Our goal for this project is to implement a convolutional neural network algorithm that can classify different types of textures. Using the PyTorch library, we trained our model on the Describable Textures Dataset from TensorFlow, which contains 120 images for each texture class.
